## Instructions

<Steps>

1. In a heatproof bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar. Place over a pot of simmering water (double boiler) and whisk constantly until the mixture is thick and pale, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.

2. In a separate bowl, whisk the mascarpone cheese until smooth and creamy.

3. Gently fold the cooled egg mixture into the mascarpone until well combined.

4. In another bowl, whip the heavy cream to stiff peaks, then gently fold it into the mascarpone mixture.

5. Combine the cooled espresso with coffee liqueur (if using) in a shallow dish.

6. Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture (don't soak them - just a quick dip on each side).

7. Arrange a layer of dipped ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9x13 inch dish.

8. Spread half of the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers.

9. Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining cream.

10. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.

11. Before serving, dust generously with cocoa powder and add chocolate shavings if desired.

## Tips for Success

- **Raw eggs**: Use pasteurized eggs if you're concerned about raw eggs, or use the double boiler method shown above to cook them gently
- **Don't oversoak**: Ladyfingers should be moistened but not soggy - a quick dip is all you need
- **Quality matters**: Use good quality espresso and mascarpone for the best flavor
- **Make ahead**: Tiramisu tastes even better the next day after flavors have melded
- **Dust just before serving**: Add cocoa powder right before serving to keep it from getting absorbed
