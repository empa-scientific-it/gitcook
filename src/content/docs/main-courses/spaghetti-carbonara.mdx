## Instructions

<Steps>

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for the pasta.

2. While waiting, dice the guanciale into small cubes and cook in a large pan over medium heat until crispy. Remove from heat and set aside.

3. In a bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, whole egg, and grated Pecorino Romano. Add a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.

4. Cook the spaghetti according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta cooking water before draining.

5. Add the drained pasta directly to the pan with the guanciale (off the heat).

6. Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing constantly.

7. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time, tossing vigorously, until you achieve a creamy, silky sauce that coats the pasta.

8. Serve immediately with extra Pecorino and black pepper on top.

## Important Tips

- **Temperature is key**: The pan should be off the heat when adding eggs to prevent scrambling
- **Move fast**: Work quickly to create the emulsion while the pasta is still hot
- **No cream**: Authentic carbonara uses only eggs, cheese, and pasta water for creaminess
- **Guanciale vs Pancetta**: Guanciale (pork jowl) is traditional, but pancetta works too
